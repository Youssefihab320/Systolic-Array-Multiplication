# Systolic-Array-Multiplication
This project implements a NÃ—N systolic array architecture for matrix multiplication using SystemVerilog. The design leverages a grid of processing elements (PEs) that perform parallel multiply-accumulate operations, enabling high-throughput matrix computations suitable for AI accelerators and hardware pipelines.

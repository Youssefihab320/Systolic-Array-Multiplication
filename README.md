# Systolic-Array-Multiplication
This project implements a N×N systolic array architecture for matrix multiplication using SystemVerilog. The design leverages a grid of processing elements (PEs) that perform parallel multiply-accumulate operations, enabling high-throughput matrix computations suitable for AI accelerators and hardware pipelines.

# Features
✅ Parameterized 5×5 matrix multiplication 
✅ Fully synthesizable RTL (systolic_array.sv) 
✅ Testbench with multiple test cases (systolic_array_tb.sv) 
✅ Valid control and data input/output ports 
✅ Matches digital hardware lab specifications
